# One Board can have many columns
# One Column can have many tickets
# One Ticket can have many comments
# One Board can have One owner but many editors

# CURRENT PROBLEMS:
# - Teams can have multiple boards
# - Teams have many members of different rank
# - How do I get editors to inherit from the parent type
