# ðŸ’© Craplo - A Crappy Trello Clone

## The Summary

I built this to demonstrate how quickly you can build complex functional applications with serverless infrastructure like AWS Amplify and Next JS.

## The Stack

This Trello Clone was built using:

- AWS Amplify
- Next JS
- Material UI
- TypeScript (basic)

It took me about 4 weeks of coding after work to build this project start to finish.

## Key Features

- **Multi-User** Authenticated Access to Workspaces and Boards.
- Very similar **functionality** replication of the real Trello boards.
- User-based Access Restrictions on the **GraphQL API**.
- Social Sign in with Facebook & Google.
- Next JS 10.0 Image Component.
- React Context for "global" user and theme state.

## About Me

If you like what you see, I recently started making programming content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJae_agpt9S3qwWNED0KHcQ).

I would really appreciate if you considered checking it out. _Thanks_!
